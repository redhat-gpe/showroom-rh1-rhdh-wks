== Craft your first Golden Path Template

* In the previous lab, you witnessed a *Golden Path Template* in action.
* We explained that a *Golden Path Template* is defined using a YAML file.
* This file is processed by the *Scaffolder*, *RHDH*'s templating engine, which executes the steps outlined in the template.
* This lab will guide you through creating your very first *Golden Path Template*.

'''

=== Hello World Template

* Let's look at an example to grasp how templates are defined. And what better starting point than the classic Hello World template!

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: my-first-template
  title: Hello World
  description: A simple Hello World example.
spec:
  owner: rhdh
  type: service

  parameters:
    - title: Enter the name you'd like to greet.
      required:
        - name
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
          default: World
    - title: Input the name of the greeter.
      required:
        - greeter
      properties:
        greeter:
          type: string
          default: RHDH

  steps:
    - id: log-message
      name: Log Message
      action: debug:log
      input:
        message: 'Hello, ${{ parameters.name }} from ${{ parameters.greeter }}!'

  output:
    message: 'The parameters you provided are: ${{ parameters.name }} and ${{ parameters.greeter }}'
----

* You'll note that the template is divided into four  sections:
. *Header*: Here, you provide essential information about the template.
. *Parameters*: This section is for gathering inputs from the user.
. *Steps*: In this section, you define the actions to be executed by the *Scaffolder*.
. *Output*: This section is optional and allows you to provide details about the tasks performed by the *Scaffolder*.

---

=== Template Header

* The header section is mandatory for every template.
* The *Component* card on the *Create Component* page is displayed based on the details in the Header section.
* For example, this is the header of the Golden Path Template you used in the previous lab:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: quarkus-stssc-template
  title: Securing a Quarkus Service Software Supply Chain
  description: Create a simple microservice built on a trusted software supply chain
  tags:
    - recommended
    - java
    - quarkus
    - maven
spec:
  owner: rhdh
  type: service
----

* The Component card was displayed by *RHDH* based on the header information, including the title, description, and tags.

image::Component_Card.png[]

* In any template, the fields *apiVersion*, *kind*, and *metadata.name* are required.
* RHDH recognizes that this yaml file defines a Template when you set the field *kind* to *Template*.
* The fields *spec.owner* and *spec.type* are also required
.. *spec.owner* denotes the team responsible for the template.
.. While *spec.type* indicates the type of component produced.
* The spec.type field can be a:
.. service - a backend service, typically with an API
.. website - a front-end website
.. library - a software library, such as an npm module or a Java library

---

===  Template Parameters

* Within the template, the parameters property is used to generate the form.
* You can choose to break up the parameter prompting into *form steps* or collect all the parameters in a single step.
* For example in our *Hello World* template, we defined two steps, one to input the *name* and another to input the *greeter* as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
    - title: Enter the name you'd like to greet.
      required:
        - name
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
          default: World
    - title: Input the name of the greeter.
      required:
        - greeter
      properties:
        greeter:
          type: string
          default: RHDH
----

* In other words the parameters property is an array of objects, each entry in the array is a *form step*.
* Each form step must specify a *title*, which *properties* it will ask from the user, and if any of them is *required*.
* A property type can be: *string*, *number*, *array*, or *object*.
* You can also specify options for each property, such as default values or a list of possible values.

---

=== Template Steps

* Steps define the actions that are performed by the *Scaffolder* template during its execution.
* They are executed sequentially as defined in the template.
* Each step utilizes actions for tasks such as publishing to a git repository or registering a component in the catalog.
* RHDH offers various built-in actions, and you can define custom actions as well.
* In our *Hello World* template we have defined one step *log-message*, which uses the action *debug:log* to display a message to the user.

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
    - id: log-message
      name: Log Message
      action: debug:log
      input:
        message: 'Hello, ${{ parameters.name }} from ${{ parameters.greeter }}!'
----

* To see the available actions in *RHDH* and understand their usage, go to the *Create Content* page by selecting *Create* from the left sidebar menu.
* Next, open the *Kebab* menu at the top right of the *Create Content* page and choose *Installed Actions*.

image::Installed_Actions.png[]

* Search for *debug:log* to learn more about this action, including viewing some examples.

image::debug-log-action.png[]

---

=== Template Output

* Output allows to display results to the user or use the output from executing actions.
* In our *Hello World* template we are simply displaying the input that the user provided

[source,yaml]
----
  output:
    message: 'The parameters you provided are: ${{ parameters.name }} and ${{ parameters.greeter }}'
----

* To register a component in our catalog, for instance, we would use the *catalog:register* action.
* As with the *debug:log* action, you can review the expected input and output for this action.

image::Catalog_Register_Action.png[]

* This is how we would set up the Step to run the action *catalog:register* and then use its output parameter *entityref* to give the user a link to access the component in the Catalog.

[source,yaml]
----
steps:
    - id: register
      name: Register
      action: catalog:register
      input:
        repoContentsUrl: ${{ repoContentsUrl }}
        catalogInfoPath: "/catalog-info.yaml"
output:
    links:
      - title: Open Component in catalog
        icon: catalog
        entityRef: {{ '${{ steps.register.output.entityRef }}' }}
----

* We are now ready to test the *Hello World* template and see it in action.

---

== Test Hello World Template

* First clone the repo that hosts the software templates to your local drive by executing the following command in a local terminal on your laptop:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+",role="execute"]
----
git clone {gitlab_url}/rhdh/rh1-software-templates.git
----

* *RHDH* ships with a convenient *Template Editor* tool that lets you preview and try out templates.
* To access the *Template Editor* navigate to the *Create Content* page by clicking on *Create* in the left sidebar menu.
* Then expand the *Kebab menu* on the upper right of the *Create Content* page and click on *Template Editor*.

image::template_editor.png[]

* Select  the first option *Load Template Directory*

image::Select_Template_Editor.png[]

* Navigate to the path where you cloned the software templates repo and select the folder *scaffolder-templates/hello-world-template*

image::select-hello-worlds-template.png[]

* You will see a pop-up with the message *"let site view files"*, click on *View files*
* The *Template Editor* provides a preview of the form that will be presented to the user.

image::Form-Preview.png[]

* In our template, we've set up the *name* and *greeter* fields in two separate *form steps*, which is why they'll appear to the user in separate forms..
* You can either enter a *name* or keep the default value, then click *Next Step*.
* Repeat this for the greeter field and click *Next Step* again.
* Review the input you provided, then click *Create*.
* You'll see the results of running the template in dry-run mode.
* Toggle between the *log* and *output* tabs to see the results.

image::Template_Results.png[]

---

== Modify Hello World Template

* It probably did not make much sense to split the name and greeter fields into two forms, so let's merge them into a single form.
* We also need to ensure that the user selects a greeter only from the list of groups available in the *RHDH* Catalog.
* Lastly, the format of the name entered by the user must adhere to specific rules:
. It must begin with a capital letter.
. It can include only letters (upper or lower case), numbers, or underscores.
. Its maximum length can only be 5 letters.

=== Requirement 1: Merge into a single form

* To include both *name* and *greeter* in a single form, we will move all the attributes of the *greeter* property to the first *form step*, similar to the yaml structure shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
    - title: Enter the values for name and greeter
      required:
        - name
        - greeter
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
          default: World
        greeter:
          type: string
          default: RHDH
----

=== Requirement 2: Greeter can only be selected from list of groups

* RHDH includes built-in UI fields designed to make it easier for users to input valid values.
* For this requirement we can use the *Owner Picker*, which returns a selection of both groups and users registered in the *RHDH* Catalog.
* We can implement a filter so that the OwnerPicker would shows only entities of kind *group*, as shown in the following yaml structure.

[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
    - title: Enter the values for name and greeter
      required:
        - name
        - greeter
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
          default: World
        greeter:
          type: string
          ui:field: OwnerPicker
          ui:options:
            catalogFilter:
              kind: Group
----

=== Requirement 3: Name format rules

* *RHDH* supports the use of regular expressions to ensure that a string conforms to specific rules.
* For our purpose, we can utilize the regex:: ^[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_]*$
. [A-Z] ensures the first character is a capital letter (A to Z).
. [A-Za-z0-9_] allows any number of alphanumeric characters (both upper and lower case) and underscores after the first character.
. The asterisk means zero or more of the preceding element.
* The *maxLength* option can be used to limit the maximum length of name to 5.
* Finally, we can also provide hints to guide the user in understanding these rules, as shown in the following yaml structure.

[source,yaml,role="execute"]
----
parameters:
    - title: Enter the values for name and greeter
      required:
        - name
        - greeter
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
          default: World
          maxLength: 5
          pattern: '^[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9_]*$'
          ui:help: 'Hint: name must begin with a capital letter, include only letters (upper or lower case), numbers, or underscores, and the maximum length can only be 5 letters.'
        greeter:
          type: string
          ui:field: OwnerPicker
          ui:options:
            catalogFilter:
              kind: Group
----

* Go ahead and modify the *Hello World Template* with the new parameters, then reload it to test the changes in parameters and user form.

== Bonus Lab

* Here is a challenge for you: Apply what you've learned to craft a **Golden Path Template** that creates and registers a new component in the RHDH Catalog.
* First, get a feel for how this GPT functions by trying it out yourself.
* Navigate to the **Create View** by clicking **Create** in the left side-menu..
* Then select the template **Onboard your component to RHDH**.

image::bonus_lab_select_template.png[]

* Run the template, keeping a close eye on the form parameters.

image::bonus_lab_form.png[]

* Here are the four sections of this template, but some of them are incomplete.
* Your challenge is to fill in these incomplete parts, drawing upon your learning from today's workshop.
* Find the template in the software templates repository you cloned earlier, under **scaffolder-templates/register-component-lab**, and add the missing parameters using your preferred editor.

=== Template Header

* As discussed in the **Hello World** template, the header determines how the tile for this GPT appears in the **Create View**.
* This YAML source in this section is just for your understanding, and there is nothing that you need to do here.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: add-component-template
  title: Onboard your component to RHDH
  description: Create and register a new component to RHDH Catalog
  tags:
    - bonus
    - rhone
spec:
  owner: rhdh
  type: service
----

===  Template Parameters

* We now focus on the parameters section of the template. The forms you interacted with when you executed template are based on the parameters defined here.
* In the YAML source provided hereunder, you will notice that the first **form steps** has no parameters defined.
* Your task is to replace the placeholder **Add form parameters here** with two new parameter definitions:
. **component_id** with the title **Name**, a type of **string**, and a maximum character limit of 20.
. **description** with the title **Description** and a type of **string**.
* After completing these additions, you can test the new form parameters by loading the template in the **Template Editor** and running the template in **dry-run** mode.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes",role="execute"]
----
parameters:
    - title: Provide new component details
      required:
        - component_id
      properties:
        # Add form parameters here
    - title: Application repository Information
      required:
        - repo
      properties:
        repo:
          title: Repository Location
          type: object
          properties:
            host:
              title: Repo Host
              type: string
              description: Your SCM host
              default: gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}
              enum:
                - gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}
            owner:
              title: Repo Owner
              type: string
              description: Your SCM host organization/group
              default: development
              enum:
                - development
----

=== Template Steps

* The section defines the steps to be performed by this template.
* Running this template will execute the following steps:
. Fetch the config-info file from Gitlab using the *fetch:template* action.
. Publish a new repo for your component in Gitlab using the *publish:gitlab* action.
. Register the new component in the RHDH Catalog using the *catalog:register* action.
* In the following YAML source, review the **catalog:register** action, one of the input parameters, **repoContentsUrl**, is only partially defined.
* The value of *repoContentsUrl* is sourced from the **publish:gitlab** action's output, as indicated in the commented part **steps.publish.output.REPLACE_ME**.
* The **Scaffolder** templating engine will automatically replace variables in curly braces with their actual values.
* Remember that you can explore available actions by clicking on the *Kebab* menu at the top right of the *Create Content* page and then selecting *Installed Actions*.
* In this page you can search for *publish:gitlab*.
Your task is to identify the output variable from **publish:gitlab** that provides **A URL to the root of the repository** and replace text **REPLACE_ME** with the appropriate output parameter name.

[source,yaml,role="execute"]
----
steps:
    - id: template
      name: Fetch Skeleton + Template
      action: fetch:template
      input:
        url: ./skeleton
        copyWithoutTemplating:
          - .github/workflows/*
        values:
          component_id: '${{ parameters.component_id }}'
          description: '${{ parameters.description }}'
          owner: '${{ user.entity.metadata.name }}'
          host: '${{ parameters.repo.host }}'
          destination: '${{ parameters.repo.owner }}'/'${{ parameters.component_id }}'

    - id: publish
      name: Publish
      action: publish:gitlab
      input:
        repoUrl: '"${{ parameters.repo.host }}?owner=${{ parameters.repo.owner }}&repo=${{parameters.component_id}}"'
        repoVisibility: public

    - id: register
      name: Register
      action: catalog:register
      input:
        # repoContentsUrl: '${{ steps.publish.output.REPLACE_ME }}'
        catalogInfoPath: "/catalog-info.yaml"
----

=== Template Output

* The output section displays results to the user, based on the output from the executed actions.
* This template displays two outputs:
. The URL of the source code repository.
. A link to the newly created entity in the RHDH Catalog

image::bonus_lab_output.png[]

* In the following YAML source, the output parameter **entityRef** is not fully defined yet.
* It expects a value from the **catalog:register** action's output.
* Your task is to find the output variable from **catalog:register** that provides **entityRef** and substitute the text **REPLACE_ME** with the correct output parameter name.

[source,yaml,role="execute"]
----
  output:
    links:
      - title: Source Code Repository
        url: '${{ steps.publish.output.remoteUrl }}'
      - title: Open Component in catalog
        icon: catalog
        #entityRef: '${{ steps.register.output.REPLACE_ME }}'
----

TIP: The solution to the Bonus lab can be found in the folder where you cloned the software templates repo under the path *scaffolder-templates/register-component*
