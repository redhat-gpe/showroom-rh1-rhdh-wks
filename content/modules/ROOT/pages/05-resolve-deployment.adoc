= Challenge: Resolve Deployment Issues

This part of the workshop is optional and tests your knowledge on resolving Openshift deployment related issues particulary around the risk of over provisioning of resources.

== Updating the globex-ui deployment file

In the previous section you were made aware of a deployment file issue with respect to missing *requests/limits*.  You will now attempt to resolve the *requests/limits* policy violation:

. Using the terminal and the git clone command, clone the project *dev-user* with username and password *openshift*
. Under the *gitops* root directory, navigate to the *kustomize* base folder of the globex application and identify the *globex-ui* deployment file
. Add requests of *100m cpu* and *200Mi memory*
. Add limits of *200m cpu* and *400Mi memory*
. Commit your changes back to the repository
. Trigger the pipeline as mentioned previously.
. Switch back to {openshift_console_url}[Openshift,window=read-later] and click *Pipelines > Pipelines* from the left menu.  Notice that another instance of your pipeline run has started.  Wait for it to complete.

== Examine pipeline
. Click on the pipeline and then click on the *acs-deploy-check* task.
. The critical warning has now been resolved and does not show up in the logs.
