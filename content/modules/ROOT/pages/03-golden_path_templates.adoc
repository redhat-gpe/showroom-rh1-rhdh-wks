== How Golden Paths Templates Simplify Developer Experience

* In the first section of this workshop, we explained some common challenges that developers face: navigating through disorganized systems and dealing with incomplete or outdated documentation.
* Now, let's explore how the Golden Path Templates can transform that frustrating experience into a positive one.

'''

=== How Do Golden Path Templates Transform the Developer Experience?

* One of the primary use cases for *Red Hat Developer Hub* is to streamline the onboarding of new team members leveraging *Golden Path Templates*.
* These templates offer guided, self-service approaches to building components.
* A *Golden Path Template* is defined using a YAML file, which outlines the necessary parameters and steps for execution.
* The *Scaffolder*, *RHDH*'s templating engine, facilitates the execution of these steps as defined in the *YAML* file.
* Each step utilizes built-in *Actions* to perform various tasks, such as creating workspaces, generating application skeletons, pushing changes to *GitLab*, or triggering CI/CD pipelines.
* When the *Scaffolder* processes a template, it generates input forms, rendered based on the parameters specified in the template.
* It then proceeds to execute the steps outlined in the template.
* *Golden Path Templates* help developers create new components with ease, and in a self-service manner, while ensuring compliance with organizational best practices.

In the next section, we will guide you through the process of executing your first *Golden Path Template*.

'''

=== Launching your first Golden Path Template (GPT)

* As a new developer, you are asked to join a project and implement a modification to a feature within a Quarkus-based service.
* To do that you are going to use a pre-configured *Golden Path Template*, which is going to streamline your onboarding process to your new project and perform the following in a self service manner:

. The GPT is going to create two repositories in Gitlab, one for the application source code and the other for ArgoCD Manifests.
. The next step in the GPT will instruct ArgoCD to create an application and all the specified resources in the Manifests in the target OpenShift cluster.
. In this example we are using Helm charts as an input to ArgoCD to deploy:
    .. A CI pipeline in Tekton to build your application and a webhook event listener that is triggered on every commit to the source code repository.
    .. All the Kubernetes resources needed to deploy the *my-quarkus-app*, including a Deployment, Service and Route.

image::GPT_Flow.png[]

TIP: Feel free to explore both repositories by accessing the link:{gitlab_url}/development/my-quarkus-app[Source Code Repo,window=_blank] and the link:{gitlab_url}/development/my-quarkus-app-gitops[GitOps Manifests Repo,window=_blank]

* To launch the *Golden Path Template*, click on *Create* in the sidebar menu.
* You will be presented with all the Golden Path Templates that the Platform Engineering team configured for you.
* Right now we have only two templates, but we could have as many as we need.
* Click the *Choose* link on the bottom right of the “Securing a Quarkus Service Software Supply Chain“ tile to select this template.

image::Choose_GPT.png[]

* Next, you'll be prompted to fill out a simple form with basic information.
* Unlike a classic ticket system, this wizard-style interface is intuitive and tailored specifically for this project, ensuring a quick and straightforward process.
* Keep the default values in the first form and click *NEXT STEP* to proceed.

image::GPT_form_1.png[]

* In the second form, choose *Quay* from the *Image Registry* dropdown.

image::GPT_form_2.png[]

* This action automatically populates relevant default values, including the Quay server host, the organization for your container image repositories, and the tag for your base image.
* Keep the default values and click *NEXT STEP* to proceed.

image::GPT_form2_update.png[]

* In the third and final form, you'll see pre-filled default values for the Git server hosting your application's source code repository, the repository containing the GitOps manifests, and the GitLab group for these repositories.
* Again keep the default values and click *NEXT STEP* to proceed.

image::GPT_form_3.png[]

* You will be presented with a summary.
* You can now review that everything is in order then click the *Create* button.

image::GPT_Summary.png[]

* After clicking the *Create* button, Red Hat Developer Hub will utilize the information you've provided to initiate the setup process as outlined in the selected Golden Path Template.
* It will also register your application in the *Catalog*.
* Now, proceed by clicking the *Open Component in catalog* link.

image::GPT_Complete.png[]

'''

=== Exploring the RHDH Dashboard

* On clicking the *Open Component in catalog*,  the *RHDH Dashboard* will launch in a new tab.
* Here you have everything you need to work on your task and implement that new feature in the Quarkus application.
* Let’s take a moment to explore the different tabs available starting with the *Overview* tab.

'''

=== Overview tab

* The *Overview* tab displays a few tiles such as:

. The *Links* tile: Gives you access to your Cloud Development Environment link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces,window=_blank]. You can choose your preferred IDE, either *Microsoft Visual Studio Code* or *JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA*.
. The *Merge request statistics* tile offers insights into your *GitLab* merge requests.
. The *About* tile: Allows direct access to your application's source code that was just created for you in *GitLab* via the *View Source* link and to the application documentation through the *View TechDocs* link.
. The *ArgoCD overview* tile displays the current status of your application in *ArgoCD* (This may take a few minutes to sync and display the application status.).

Let’s start by creating the workspace for your application by clicking on the *OpenShift Dev Spaces (VScode)* link.

image::RHDH_Dashboard.png[]

* This will launch the login process in a new tab. To login into *OpenShift Dev Spaces*,follow these step:

. Choose to *login with OpenShift*
. Select *login with rhsso*
. Then enter your OpenShift credentials with user `{openshift_admin_user}` and password `{openshift_admin_password}`
. Authorize *OpenShift Dev Spaces* to access your account by clicking the *Allow selected permissions* button.
. You'll then be prompted to sign into *GitLab*. Click the *Sign in* button to proceed.
. Finally, authorize *OpenShift Dev Spaces* to use your *GitLab* account by clicking the *Authorize* button.

* Once logged in, *OpenShift Dev Spaces* will automatically locate the *Devfile* in your *GitLab* repository and begin processing it to create your workspace.

* While *OpenShift Dev Spaces* is setting up your workspace, let's take this opportunity to further explore the *RHDH Dashboard*.
* Return to the *Overview* tab in your browser and select the *View TechDocs* link in the *About* tile.

NOTE: You can also access the Documentation from by selecting Docs from the upper menu.

image::TechDocs_Link.png[]

'''

=== Docs tab

* Here you can see the technical documentation for the *my-quarkus-app* component.
* *RHDH* follows a **doc-like-code* approach as explained in the previous section.
* The documentation is written in *Markdown* format and hosted in the same Git repository as the component source code.
* The *Docs* tab displays the documentation in *HTML* format, which has been generated and published as part of the execution of our *Golden Path Template*.

image::View_TechDocs.png[]

* You can also open any documentation related issue directly from the *Docs* tab.
* For example, we are not impressed by the level of detail provided in this document.
* Let's flag this for the team's attention.
* To do so, highlight the text 'A cool Quarkus app.'
* A small popup will appear with the option *Open GitLab Issue.*
* Click on the popup.

image::Create_Issue.png[]

* This will open a new tab in your browser to allow you to create an issue in *Gitlab*.
* When creating the issue, you can replace the text ‘replace this line with your comment’ with the following feedback: 'The current details are quite sparse, please enrich the documentation.’.
* Then click the *Create issue* button.

image::Provide_Issue_Details.png[]

* Switch back to Developer Hub tab in your browser.
* On the top right corner, under the *Component* heading, click 'my-quarkus-app'.
* Then navigate to the *Issues* tab by selecting it from the upper menu.
* The issue you've raised is now visible and can be tracked by all developers collaborating on the project.

image::Issues_View.png[]

* It's time to examine how *RHDH* has modeled our application in the Software Catalog.
* Look for the *Dependencies* option in the top menu.
* If *Dependencies* isn't immediately visible, use the navigation arrows to scroll left through the menu options until you find it.

image::Dependencies_Tab.png[]


'''

=== Dependencies tab

* The *Dependencies* view allows you to inspect your application’s relationships and dependencies as we explained in the previous section.

image::Dependencis_View.png[]

* In this example we can quickly understand that we have a component called *my-quarkus-app*.
* This component provides an API with the same name and is owned by the group named *user1*.

image::My-quarkus-app-diagram.png[]

* Now let’s explore the *my-quarkus-app* API by clicking on it in the relationship diagram.

'''

=== API tab

* In the *API* view, you'll find a lot of helpful information including access to source code, documentation, and a visual representation of relationships from the API's perspective.
* To interact with your API, select the *Definition* tab.

image::API_View.png[]

* Here you'll find a *Swagger UI*, which provides an interactive interface for exploring and testing your API's requests.

image::Swagger_UI.png[]

* Switch back to the “Overview” tab, and under *owner* click on the link corresponding to your user, which in our example is labeled as {rhdh_user}.

image::Switch_To_Owner_View.png[]

'''

=== Ownership tab

* As we discussed in the workshop introduction, it is often very hard to understand who owns which component.
* However, *RHDH* simplifies this by clearly displaying the group responsible for the component and APIs you're working with, complete with contact details. You can also view all related components and APIs managed by this group.
* So really *Red Hat Developer Hub* makes it very easy to find and explore every aspect of your application from within the comfort of your *RHDH dashboard*.
* Now, let's navigate back to our application component.
* Click on the link labeled *1 SERVICE Component* to return to the *RHDH Software Catalog*.

image::Ownership_view.png[]

* Select the *my-quarkus-app* component from the list to navigate back to your *Dashboard*.

image::Catalog_View_From_Ownership_Link.png[]

'''

=== Topology tab

* Select the *Topology* tab from the upper menu.
* This view, powered by an *RHDH Plugin*, brings the familiar *OpenShift Topology* view experience into the *Red Hat Developer Hub*, allowing you to visualize the workloads within your Kubernetes namespace.
* Immediately, you'll notice a red ring around your *Pod*, indicating a startup issue.
* Hover over the Pod to reveal an *ErrImagePull* error.
* When you click on the Pod, a side pane slides in from the right to show more details.
* Switch to the *Resources* tab to dig deeper into this error.
* You'll see an ImagePullBack error which could be the result of a missing image in the Image Registry. 
* To confirm this, let's proceed to the *Image Registry* view by selecting it from the upper menu.

image::Topology_View.png[]

'''

=== Image Registry tab

* Under the hood we are using a *Plugin* to enrich the *Image Registry* view with insights from a *Quay* hosted registry.
* As we anticipated, the *Image Registry* is currently empty.
* To address this, let's switch back to the browser tab where you logged-in *Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces* at the beginning of this section.

image::Image_Registry_Tab.png[]

'''

=== Implementing a code change in OpenShift Dev Spaces

* Your IDE should now be loaded and ready in a browser tab.
* Click on the *Yes, I Trust the Authors* button to proceed.

image::Dev_Spaces_Trust_Authors.png[]

* To accomplish your task, you are going to do three things:

. Update the hello method in the ExampleResource.java class.
. Update the JUnit test that verifies the output from this method.
. Update the documentation to reflect your change.

NOTE: In case you are wondering, the JUnit test for the Hello method needs to be updated otherwise the *Build* step in our CI/CD pipeline will fail due to the discrepancy between the code and its test.

* In your *my-quarkus-app* workspace, expand the folders *src -> main -> java*, and then open the file *ExampleResource.java*.
* On line 14, replace the return message of the hello method from "Hello RESTEasy" to “Hello from RHDH”.

image::Modify_ExampleResource.png[]

* Next, update the *JUnit* test for this method.
* Expand the folders *src -> main -> test*, and open the file *ExampleResourceTest.java*.
* On line 18, change the expected text from "Hello RESTEasy" to “Hello from RHDH”.

image::Modify_ExampleResourceTest.png[]

* Finally, let's update the Documentation with our latest changes.
* Expand the *docs* folder and open the file *Index.md*.
* At the end of the document, add the following text: "Release 1.0: Update to ExampleResource.hello() method to return 'Hello from RHDH'.".
* Now, click on the *Source Control* icon in the left menu.

image::Index_File.png[]

* Enter the commit message “My First Commit” and then click on the *Commit* button.
* In the pop-up window that follows, click *Yes* to stage your changes.
* Finally, click on the *Sync Changes* button and in the pop-up the follows click *OK* to push your changes and complete the process.
* You have now successfully implemented your change and updated the documentation in one commit.

* That commit should have triggered the build pipeline for the *my-quarkus-app* component through the event trigger.
* Switch back to *RHDH Dashboard* tab in your browser and select the *CI* tab from the top menu.

image::My_First_Commit.png[]

'''

=== CI tab

* The *CI* tab enables you to track the progress of the build pipeline for the *my_quarkus_app* component.

NOTE: The pipeline can take up to 10 minutes to finish.

* Notice how security measures are baked into the build pipeline, adhering to the policies set by the security team.
* These measures include:

. Static code analysis using *Sonarqube*.
. Verify the latest commit, which triggered the pipeline, was digitally signed by a trusted source.
. Generate *SBOM* (Software Bill of Materials) generation, to gain insights into the makeup of the application.
. Integration with *ACS* (Advanced Cluster Security) to scan the image for any vulnerabilities.

* As a developer, you don't need to worry about these complex aspects.
* They are all prepared for you through the Golden Path approach, ensuring a streamlined and secure development process.
* In fact, we could even replace Tekton with another CI tool, and you wouldn’t need to be concerned with the details!
* Once the build pipeline execution is complete, let's review the status of our application.
* Switch to the *Topology* tab.

image::CI_Tab.png[]

'''

=== Check application status

* In the *Topology* view, you will now see that our Pod is surrounded by a healthy blue ring, indicating that the Pod is running successfully.
* To open the application, click on the small icon located at the top right of the Pod.
* Your application will open in a new browser tab.

image::Topology_Tab_Pod_Running.png[]

* Test the change you implemented by clicking on the 'hello' link; you should see the API return “Hello from RHDH” as expected.

image::My_Qurkus_App_Running.png[]

* Next, switch to the *Overview* tab.
* Here, you will notice that the application is synced and showing a healthy status in *ArgoCD*.

image::ArgoCD_Healthy_Status.png[]

* Then, move to the *Image Registry* tab.
* The *Registry* should now be populated with images.
* View the *Scan Results* by clicking on the link under the *Security Scan* column for the image tagged as *latest* to review its scan results.


image::Scanned_Image_In_Quay.png[]

* This section will display all the vulnerabilities identified for this image, providing crucial security insights.

image::Scan_Results.png[]

* Finally, switch to the *Docs* tab.
* Here, you can verify that the documentation has been updated with the changes you made earlier.

image::Updated_Docs.png[]
