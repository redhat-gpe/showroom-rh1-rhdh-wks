'''

=== RHDH Landing Page

* The *Landing Page* of *Red Hat Developer Hub* is your gateway to a vast array of critical information and tools.
* Here, *Red Hat* has thoughtfully pinned key resources for immediate access, ranging from developer tools and CI/CD tools to monitoring and security tools.
* For a practical demonstration of *RHDH*'s capabilities, we have registered a dummy application called *rh-one* in the *Software Catalog*.

Next, let’s explore how this application is modeled in the *Software Catalog* in the following section.

'''

=== The Software Catalog

* The *Software Catalog* serves as a centralized directory, listing all services, libraries, and documentation in one easily accessible location.
* It enables two main use-cases:
. *Streamlining Software Management:* The Catalog provides teams a unified view of their entire software portfolio, including services, libraries, websites, ML models, and more.
. *Enhancing Discoverability:* The Catalog makes all software within your organization easily discoverable, including details about their current status and ownership details.

* Go ahead and click on *Catalog* in the left menu.

image::Open_Catalog.png[]

* In the Catalog view you will see the two components of our *rh-one* application: the frontend and the backend.
* To get a deeper understanding of how these components interact, click on the *rh-one-system* link.

image::RHDH_Catalog.png[]

* This leads to a detailed view of the relationships between the application’s components.
* To fully understand the dependencies between these components, click on *View graph* located at the bottom of the *Relations* panel.

image::RHOne-System.png[]

* You will be re-directed to the *Catalog Graph* view.

image::System_Relations_Graph_before_filter.png[]

* To better understand this diagram, let's adjust a few filter conditions:

. In the *Relations* section, deselect both *ownerof* and *ownedby* options.
. Choose *Top to Bottom* from the *Direction* dropdown.
. Finally, toggle off the *Simplified* option.

* Your graph will now look like the following screenshot.

image::System_Relations_Graph.png[]

* Let’s dive deeper into *RHDH relationship model*.
* In *RHDH*’s terminology, assets are referred to as *Entities*.
* The most commonly used entities are *Core* and *Organizational* entities.
* Let's explore them further:

==== Core Entities

* *Component*: Represents a software piece within your system, such as a backend service or data pipeline.
* *API*: Represents a formalized interface like a REST API, GraphQL endpoint, or gRPC service. APIs can be provided or consumed by components, and their visibility can be controlled as public, private, or restricted (available only to specific system entities).
* *Resource*: Represents a piece of infrastructure or external service that a component depends on, such as a database or an S3 bucket.
* All these entities, working together to perform a function, can be logically grouped into a *System*.

==== Organizational Entities

* *User*: Represents an individual user within your organization.
* *Group*: Represents a team or other organizational units that users are members of.

These organizational entities own the core entities and play a crucial role in maintaining and managing them.

image::System_Model.png[]

* Now that we have a better grasp of the terminology, let's examine the relationship diagram of our *rh-one* application.
* The diagram shows that all components, APIs and resources are part of the system called *rh-one-system*.
* The component named *rh-one-backend* provides an API named *events_api*, and it relies on two dependencies:
. A database called *rh_one_database*
. An S3 bucket called *events_S3*
* The other component named *rh-one-frontend* consumes the *events-api*.

* So you can immediately identify that any modifications made to the *events-api* will directly impact the *rh-one-frontend* component.
* This is how the relationship graph helps you as a developer in considering the broader system implications when planning changes to any single component.

image::Relations_Graph.png[]

NOTE: The *Catalog* is built around the concept of metadata YAML files stored together with the code, you can explore the YAML file used to generate the *rh-one* application in this link:{gitlab_url}/rhdh/rh1-software-templates/blob/main/catalogs.yaml[Yaml File,window=_blank] 

'''

=== APIs

* The *API* capability within Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) simplifies the way developers discover and interact with internal and external APIs.
* To navigate to the *events_api* API view, click on *APIs* in the left menu.
* In the API's catalog, click on the *events_api* link.

image::Navigate_to_apis_view.png[]

* This functionality mirrors the *Software Catalog*'s capabilities, presenting similar information and diagrams, but with a focus on APIs.
* In the next lab, we will demonstrate how developers can interact directly with these APIs using a *Swagger UI* interface.

image::events_api.png[]

'''

=== TechDocs

* Traditionally, documentation is often stored in systems separate from the codebase..
* This separation can lead to inconsistencies, as developers need to update two different systems whenever changes are made to a component.
* Instead, *RHDH* adopts a *documentation-as-code* approach. This means documentation is stored alongside the code, albeit in a separate directory.
* As a result, developers can simultaneously create new features, modify code, update documentation, and commit all these changes to the repository in a single action.

WARNING: Documentation for the *rh-one* dummy application has not been set up yet. You will experience *TechDocs* in action in the upcoming lab.

'''

=== Search

* Search in *RHDH* is a powerful feature, offering centralized search capabilities that enable developers to quickly find the information they need.
* To navigate to the *Search* view, click on *Search* in the left menu.

image::navigate_to_search.png[]

* This tool is adept at locating items in the Software Catalog, Documentation, APIs, or other resources, effectively eliminating the often time-consuming task of searching through various sources or relying on colleagues for information.
* Try searching for *rh-one* on the search page. You'll notice that the search results include all related components, APIs, and resources, similar to what you observed in the relationship graph.

'''

=== Learning Paths

* Learning Paths are a valuable tool for organizations, offering a structured way to curate and link to external educational materials.
* To navigate to the *Learning Paths* view, click on *Learning Paths* in the left menu.

image::navigate_to_learning_paths.png[]

* *Learning Paths* facilitates skill development and continuous learning for developers.
* In our example, we have created a series of Learning Paths using Red Hat’s comprehensive resources.
* The content and structure of these Learning Paths are flexible and customizable, allowing them to be tailored to meet the specific needs and goals of different customers.

=== Tech Radar

* *Tech Radar* is a tool designed for organizations to showcase the spectrum of technologies they have adopted.
* To navigate to the *Tech Radar* view, click on *Tech Radar* in the left menu.

image::navigate_to_tech_radar.png[]

* *Tech Radar** serves as a visual guide to the technologies that are adopted, those currently under trial, and those that have been put on hold.
* For example, in the realm of development languages, Kotlin is currently under assessment for potential adoption.
* On the other hand, Java runtime version 8 and earlier, along with Python, Cobol, and .Net, have been put on hold.
* This view is customizable to align with an organization's set up. It provides new developers with a clear understanding of the technologies available for use and those that are not recommended or supported within the organization.
